# Transformer-based synthetic video generator
- Generate synthetic video data using a transformer-based architercture
  - Auto-gressive sampling is a bottleneck, can we do differently
  - Using the learned simulator for training driving models
  - Scaling to more bits and larger transformer when sampling is not the bottleneck
  - Better video tokenizer
